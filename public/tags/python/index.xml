      <description>Overview Cancer classification is one of the vital areas of medical sciences. In this project, we examine the Gene Expression data for various types of cancer and classify each cancer into its subtypes. We gather the samples from GEO datasets and select the best features using the class-overlap score, standard deviation by mean ratio, ANOVA – F value and $\chi^2$ (Chi-square) statistics. We then run the following classifiers: K Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes and Decision Trees.</description>
